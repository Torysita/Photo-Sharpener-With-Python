# Photo-Sharpener-With-Python
A simple way to sharpen the edges of a photo using Python. 
I wanted to know if I could manually sharpen a blurry image enough to read illegible text. 
Conclusions: This code only works for photos with a med-high resolution. 
Depending on the quality of the photo, a more sophistacted approach may need to be used.
I would recommend using the Canny Filter for future work.
